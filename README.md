Project is based on a game-play of a football game on a 15x15 grid with 3+3 players wherein given particular parameters underlying the game, we figure out the best move for every player in the 2 teams using linear programming. The optimum move is decided at every iteration wherein each iteration corresponds to every player making one move out of the following dribble,pass or shoot. So essentially we try to optimize the moves given the current player positions and ball position. We consider two major parameters for our model- first is safety of any point on the grid which takes into account enemy team and self team distances; and second is distance from the opponent goal post. For most part of the analysis, we looked at 3v3 scenarios and at later stages, we tried increasing the number players to understand itâ€™s effect on the game-play. We used Pulp- a python library for solving the linear programming part and other visualization libraries of python were also used for displaying the game-play
